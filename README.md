If the Linkedin Account which will be handling your Linkedin Posts is not the Main Account of the Linkedin Page, then that Linkedin Account will have to be a [Content Admin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541981).

</p>

Clicking on the Twitter Icon Brings you to the Twitter-Poster Window, where after making any necessary changes you can either post directly or queue the post, to publish at another time.

</p>

Once done with the Posting, the News Article will be highlighted Yellow along with the selected Social Media Network used to publish the News Article.

The example below illustrates the yellow highlighted News Article along with the Twitter Icon signalling the Post has been posted to Linkedin already.

<h1 align="center">Troubleshooting</h1>

<details>
<summary> Blazer Not Posting To Twitter/Linkedin </summary>
<br>

This can be attributed to many things:

1) First check whether you have entered in your Account Information for your Twitter, and or Linkedin in the Accounts Window.

2) Secondly check whether the Username/Password for your account you have entered correct.

3) Thirdly your Twitter or Linkedin Account may sometimes be flagged for too many posting requests, in this situation wait 24 hours before posting through Blazer.

4) Check whether your Google Chrome Theme is set to the Default one Google Chrome supplies, having a Dark Theme or any other Theme aside from the Default one can cause Blazer to not be able to post.

<summary> Queued Posts not showing up in the Queued Window </summary>

This Issue is attributed to the fact that you have not entered in your Account Information for your Twitter, and or Linkedin in the Accounts Window.
